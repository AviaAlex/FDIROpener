# FDIROpener<br>

FDIROpener is a free and open-source portable command-line tool used to pack and unpack files.<br>
FDIROpener creates and opens .FDIR files, a very minimal and basic file archive format.<br>

# Instructions for Use<br>

Step 1. Take out your operating system's executable from the "bin" folder.<br><br>

Step 2. Open your terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the executable is.<br><br>

Step 3. Run the executable. Depending on what you want to do, you will have to use different arguments.<br><br>

If you want to write files to a .FDIR then use this command:<br>
`<executable> -i <input file> OR <input folder> -o <fdir name>`<br><br>

If you want to extract files from a .FDIR file then use this command:<br>
`<executable> -e <.fdir file> -o <output directory>`<br><br>
